# harness-adapters

This is the one skill, trigger, and routing owner for harness-specific Firstmate operations.
Load this router first, then exactly the common reference and one harness reference selected below.
When an action spans rows, load the union once rather than every reference.
Files under `references/` are resources of this skill, not additional catalogued skills.

## Path contract

The skill directory is the directory containing this `SKILL.md`.
Resolve on-demand reference links and relative links to their executable, documentation, or sibling-skill owners against the skill directory, including links named by a nested reference.
Operational paths keep the context named by their owner: `config/` and active-home settings belong to the active Firstmate home, `state/` belongs to that home, and project settings such as `.claude/settings.json` belong to the target project.

## Non-negotiable safety

Never dispatch a crewmate or secondmate on an unverified adapter.
If `config/crew-harness` or `config/secondmate-harness` names one, tell the captain under `../../../AGENTS.md` section 9 that the requested worker runtime is not verified, use firstmate's own verified runtime for current work, and ask only whether to verify the requested runtime for future work.
Do not pause current work for that choice.

On `unknown`, ask the captain instead of guessing.
A current captain override beats detection, while a per-task override governs only that dispatch.
For recovery and control, use the exact `harness=` in `state/<id>.meta`; never infer it from a model or provider.

Deliver lifecycle actions only through `../../../bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt|exit|relaunch`.
Never type an interrupt key or exit command through `fm-send`, where routing-marked lifecycle text becomes chat.
Trust handling is complete only when inspection proves the target started processing its instructions; delivery success alone is not proof.
Muse and Gemini are verified only for crewmate and scout work, never a secondmate or primary.

## Detection

`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` prints firstmate's own harness from verified environment markers, then process ancestry.
Only `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` at the launch boundary together with `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` selects Pi-signed; shared unmarked launcher ancestry remains Pi.
`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns worker marker establishment, while the README launch command owns the signed-primary boundary.
`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh crew` resolves `config/crew-harness`, where absent or `default` means firstmate's own harness.
`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh secondmate` resolves `config/secondmate-harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> firstmate's own harness.
`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` re-resolves on every spawn, and an explicit per-spawn argument wins for that spawn.
A new adapter's verified marker and command name must land in `../../../bin/fm-harness.sh`.

## Operation-to-reference matrix

Every emitted plan appends the selected or recorded harness reference after the named common references.
The `harness-adapter-routing-v1` object is the machine-readable and human-visible selection contract: choose the operation, choose the scenario within it, then append the selected harness reference.
`default` is the normal scenario when no narrower scenario applies.
Kimi establishes its unsupported primary boundary in its selected harness reference; Muse and Gemini follow Non-negotiable safety above.
A new tool remains undispatchable until the `verify` plan, its harness entry, every named owner, and the live checks land.

## Dispatch and supervision handoff

Spawn only through `bin/fm-spawn.sh` after the profile and backend checks in section 4.
The spawn must resolve a genuine isolated task worktree distinct from the primary checkout; a failed isolation assertion stops the task.
When the configured tasks-axi backlog gate applies, the spawn itself moves the work item to In flight and refuses rather than dispatching work this home has no item for, so recording the dispatch is never a separate step to remember; a manual-backend home retains the hand-editing contract in `docs/configuration.md`.
After spawning, confirm the worker is processing the brief and handle any trust dialog through `harness-adapters`.
A persistent secondmate is recorded in the secondmate registry and runtime state, never as a backlog work item.

Steer a worker with ordinary text through fail-closed `fm-send`: the message becomes a durable record in the task's steering inbox (multi-line text is legal, local and remote alike) and the worker's terminal receives only a constant doorbell line, with the watcher re-ringing an unacknowledged local message and escalating a stuck one (`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`; `bin/fm-send.sh` owns the typed-plane carve-outs).
A remote secondmate steer rides the same durable-inbox model through the remote transport; after an unconfirmed delivery, only the exact `FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id>` resend command printed by `fm-send` is safe because it preserves the request body for remote enqueue deduplication (`bin/fm-send.sh` header).
When a steer answers an open keyed decision or blocker, pass `fm-send`'s `--resolve-key` so the answer itself closes that decision record at answer time, identically for local and remote workers (contract: `bin/fm-send.sh` header).
`fm-send` is the data plane for text the worker should read; never use its key or text paths for interrupt, exit, or other lifecycle control, because routing-marked lifecycle text becomes chat the worker reasons about instead of executing.
Drive a worker's lifecycle through `bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt|exit|relaunch`, which owns the per-runtime mechanics, verifies each action, and never tears down or discards anything ([`docs/agent-control.md`](docs/agent-control.md)).
A secondmate's routed reply returns through status or a document pointer, not by firstmate peeking into its chat.
For the parent-owned correlation, recovery, and escalation contract on marked secondmate requests, see `bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`.
Supervise all live work under section 8.
